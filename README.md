# AI based medical diagnostic pathology and imaging

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Train an AI based bot that will be able to augment and support diagnostic physicians to report on the more straightforward cases while helping them to focus more of their time on the more complex diagnostics.

## Background

Lack of availability of qualified physicians globally has put dent on the affordability of standard diagnostics in developing nations and surging medical costs in developed nations. The idea intends to free up physician's time and also provide them with sound recommendations, minimizing the chances of human errors. 

Primarily, diagnostics through imaging and pathology are based on pattern recognition reinforced with human judgement. The objective of this project is to develop a tool that performs the pattern recognition and using AI and report initial observations. 

The idea is to develop this iteratively, by teaching the system one by one on focused areas of diagnosis focusing on specific ailments at a time. 


## How is it used?

Perform rigorous training with general academic principles, guidelines, available patient data, diagnosis, imaging and pathology reports, develop a robust tool.

Support, reinforcement and guidance from pathology physicians globally, developers and data scientists through the machine learning / training process. Need to complete a very rigorous learning and testing process to meet / exceed the FDA / medical body guidelines

Once demonstrated capability to deliver high quality recomendations, physicians and patients can get a second opinoin by logging into the system from anywhere globally and uploading images. 

## Capabilities, Data sources and AI methods

Need to identify low hanging diagnosis with minimal variations and complexities run the POC (proof of concept). Multiple different AI techniques will be used based on the problem at hand and the nature of the data being used for training and diagnosis. Will need to process massive images for each diagnostic cases. We will also need the following: 

  * Proper checks and balances to meet HIPA regulations on patient data.
  * Capability to consume different image formats produced by different tools already available  in the market. Also need to find ability to convert historic physical tissue slides into digital data.
  * Compliant cloud repository / environment to manage the data, processing and reporting. 
  * NLP capability and framework to learn from standard educational materials (e.g. books and journals.
  * Apply CNN / Transformation techniques for image processing.
  

## Challenges
 
  * Most HIPA and other national regulatory guidelines are very stringent and margin of error need to be near zero. However, also need to be cautious of overfitting. 
  * Significant amount of training and bias adjustment required. 
  * Huge processing power required. Large data in the cloud and data transfer rates will be a concern.
  * Physician time to support learning will be a costly.

## What next?

Partners with areas of expertise in AI, Data Science, Cloud Infrastructure, Expertise in IT regulatory aspects in Life Sciences, Developers and Pathology physicians Along with this, we need partnership with pathology groups and hospitals to come to a contractual agreement to share historic diagnostic information for training, and Academia from the field of pathology to help create a structure around the learning process.
